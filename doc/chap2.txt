  [33X[0;0YThe  central  functionality  of the Ferret package is based around the Solve
  method.  This  function  performs  a backtrack search, using the permutation
  backtracking  algorithm,  over  a  set of groups or cosets. Often users will
  want  to use a higher level function which wraps this functionality, such as
  [10XStabilizer[110X or [10XIntersection[110X. The solve function accepts a list of groups, and
  finds  their  intersection.  For  efficiency  reasons,  these  groups can be
  specified  in  a  variety of different ways. As an example, we will consider
  how  to  implement  [10XStabilizer(G, S, OnSets)[110X, the stabilizer of a set S in a
  permutation  group  G  using Solve (this is not necessary, as when Ferret is
  loaded  this method is replaced with a Ferret-based implementation). Another
  way  of  viewing  [10XStabilizer(G,  S, OnSets)[110X is as the intersection of G with
  [10XStabilizer(Sym(n),  S,  OnSets)[110X,  where  [22XSym(n)[122X  is the symmetric group on n
  points,  and  n  is at least as large as the largest moved point in G. Solve
  takes   a  list  of  objects  which  represent  groups.  Two  of  these  are
  [10XConInGroup(G)[110X,  which  represents  the group G, and [10XConStabilize(S, OnSets)[110X,
  which  represents  the group which stabilizes S. We find the intersection of
  these two groups by [10XSolve([ConInGroup(G), ConStabilize(S, OnSets)])[110X.[133X

        [33X[0;6YThe  cell to be branched on. This is the option which will most effect
        the  time  taken to search. the default is usually best. Other options
        are:  "First" (first cell), "Largest" (largest cell), "smallest2" (the
        2nd smallest cell), "random" (a random cell) and "randomsmallest" (one

        generally  make  a big difference to search, it is hard to predict the
